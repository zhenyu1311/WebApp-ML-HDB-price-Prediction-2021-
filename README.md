You can use this web app to predict HDB prices. Data is updated as of 2021. This is previously hosted on Heroku but Heroku no longer offers free hosting services. So you have to run the app locally by running the manage.py file.

Note: 


       1. Ensure you follow the entry format of the app. For example, the floor format is XX to XX, you have to input '04 to 06' , it will not work if you input, say '4 to 06' or '4 to 6'. 

      2. It is case-sensitive. For example, you should input REDHILL, but reDHilL will not work.
